## Tools used :
- tkinter module of python
- figma for interface design 
- imagecolourpicker.com for getting precise colours for the interface

## Objective of this Project :
Creating a calculator using tkinter module is very easy. The main objective of this project is designing the interface created using tkinter. As known , tkinter does not allow many options for styling and simple GUI with boring square buttons is all it can do.

Using Figma i created a sample calculator design with dimensions taken into consideration . tkinter allows us to insert images in out widgets. in addition to this if we adjust activebackground , border width ,width and height of the buttons a decently attractive Gui could be made.

## Plan:
- https://www.figma.com/community/file/966580549711931061/Calculator 
this is the interface i designed 

note: If u r using images as styling option in tkinted, dimensons should be precise. that is why i first created this plan ; then downloaded all the buttons individually and used them.

## Areas of improvement:
- scientific calculator not present 
- history of calculations collected,but no interface build to show that
- No logo
